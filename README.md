# Hate-O-Meter
A browser plugin using Django that warns users if they try to access an offensive subreddit on reddit. 
Created our own dataset by annotating a set of 1150 tweets collected from twitter, into 2 classes: Offensive & Non Offensive.
Used TF-IDF and VADER sentiment analysis tool for word embeddings and SVM for classification.
