# Hate-O-Meter

This is the course project for Privacy and Security on Online Social Media

Advisor: [Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru (PK)](https://precog.iiitd.edu.in/)

We have built a browser plugin using Django that warns users if they try to access an offensive subreddit on reddit. We have created our own dataset by annotating a set of 1150 tweets collected from twitter, into 2 classes: Offensive & Non Offensive. We used TF-IDF and VADER sentiment analysis tool for word embeddings and SVM for classification.
